# Phase 0 capability spike

What `app/spike/index.html` found when loaded in a real Tauri window on each
target. This is the gate for Phase 1: it exists to answer "does the webview on
this platform actually have what `src/web/` needs" before any of the real
frontend is wired in, not to be a permanent report -- once Phase 1 replaces
`app/spike/` with the built site, this file stops being generated and stands
as a record of what was true when the app was onboarded.

Every check and its rationale is commented in `app/spike/index.html`; this
file only records outcomes.

## Windows (WebView2 / Chromium, run locally)

Built with `npx tauri build --debug --no-bundle` from `app/`, run directly as
`qrdrop.exe`. WebView2's UA reports Chrome/152 (Edg/152) -- current Chromium,
as expected for WebView2's evergreen runtime.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `isSecureContext` | **pass** -- `true` |
| `crypto.subtle` | **pass** -- present |
| `showSaveFilePicker` | **pass** -- present (Chromium) |
| `BarcodeDetector` | **fail** -- not present. Chromium ships the Shape Detection API behind a component that WebView2 does not carry; the jsQR fallback (`src/web/qr.js`) is load-bearing on Windows, not a Firefox-only path. |
| `getUserMedia` | **pass** (API present) -- but the call itself rejects `NotAllowedError: Permission denied`, immediately, with no OS permission prompt shown. WebView2 does not surface a camera-permission dialog on its own; Phase 3 needs an explicit permission handler (`WebView2`'s `PermissionRequested` event, exposed through `tauri-plugin-*` or a custom listener) or every camera use on Windows silently fails closed. |
| `RTCPeerConnection` + ICE gather | **pass** -- a host candidate arrived immediately. Note: `iceGatheringState` never reached `complete` within 15s even after STUN produced three `srflx` candidates in one run -- see below. |
| `wss://` connect | **pass** -- connected to `wss://nos.lol` |

**Finding, not a failure:** the first version of this probe waited for
`iceGatheringState === 'complete'` and reported ICE as failing after 15s, even
though host and three `srflx` candidates had already arrived -- a fully usable
ICE setup. `complete` appears to hang indefinitely on this machine, most
likely on the two `openrelay.metered.ca` TURN entries in `ICE_SERVERS`. The
probe was rewritten to resolve on the *first usable candidate*, which is what
real signalling actually waits for (Trystero negotiates over trickle ICE, not
after `complete`) -- see the comment in `app/spike/index.html`. Left as
recorded here because the same trap is easy to reintroduce in Phase 1/2 code
that assumes `complete` fires: it may not, on this platform, in this
environment.

## Linux (WebKitGTK, CI)

_Pending -- see `.github/workflows/app-capabilities-spike.yml`, run via
`workflow_dispatch`. WebKitGTK is the known risk named in the onboarding brief
(CLAUDE.md): if `RTCPeerConnection` is present but produces no usable
candidate, or is entirely absent, that will be stated here plainly rather than
worked around._

## macOS (WKWebView, CI)

_Pending -- same workflow, `macos-latest`._

## Android

**Not run.** No Android SDK/NDK is installed on this machine yet, and
acquiring one is a multi-gigabyte download plus emulator or device setup --
deliberately not done without confirming first, even though `mise.toml` will
pin the toolchain per the onboarding brief once Phase 4 starts. This section
gets filled in as part of that phase, run against either a physical device
over `adb` or a local AVD emulator, whichever is available at the time.

## iOS

**Not run in Phase 0.** Per the onboarding brief this is a CI-only,
build-only target from Phase 4 onward (`macos-latest`, unsigned, ships
nothing) -- there is no local iOS capability check to run from a Windows
machine at any phase.
